Now, you didn't think you could just run a SETUP.exe did ya...

THIS IS LINUX !!

So far the only way I know how to do this is limit you to KUbuntu and RasPi
And give ya a .deb file (and hope for the best).

Ya download one o these:
<a href="pcheetah_current_amd64.deb">
 <img src="img/download.gif">PianoCheetah for kubuntu</a>
<a href="pcheetah_current_armhf.deb">
 <img src="img/download.gif">PianoCheetah for raspi</a>

And ya cd to whereever it went (probably your downloads folder) and go:

 - install: &nbsp; sudo dpkg -i pcheetah_current_[ARCH].deb<br>
   [ARCH] is either amd64 for kubuntu &nbsp; or &nbsp; armhf for raspi<br>
   ...cuz linux.

 - remove: &nbsp; sudo dpkg -P pcheetah
