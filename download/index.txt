Now, you didn't think you could just run a SETUP.exe did ya...

THIS IS LINUX !!

So far the only way I know how to do this is limit you to KUbuntu and RasPi
And give ya a .deb file (and hope for the best).

Ya download one o these:
<a href="pcheetah_20230114_amd64.deb">
 <img src="img/download.gif">PianoCheetah for kubuntu</a>
(pianocheetah for raspi will happen pretty soon too)

And ya cd to whereever it went (probably your downloads folder) and go:

 - install: &nbsp; sudo dpkg -i pcheetah_whatev.deb

 - remove: &nbsp; sudo dpkg -P pcheetah

Hey!  Don't be a stranger - if you got questions I'm here ta answer em.
