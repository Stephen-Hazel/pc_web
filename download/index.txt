Now, you didn't think you could just run a SETUP.exe did ya...

THIS IS LINUX !!

So far the only way I know how to do this is limit you to KUbuntu and RasPi
And give ya a .deb file (and hope for the best).

Ya download one o these:

<a href="pcheetah_20230114_amd64.deb">pianocheetah for kubuntu</a>
(pianocheetah for raspi will happen pretty soon too)

And ya cd to whereever it went (probably your downloads folder) and go:

install:<br>
 &nbsp; sudo dpkg -i pcheetah_whatev.deb

remove:<br>
 &nbsp; sudo dpkg -P pcheetah

Hey!  Don't be a stranger - if you got questions I'm here ta answer em.


<h3>old windows stuff</h3>

Here are some old windows SETUP.exes I still have.
<a href="SETUP_PIANOCHEETAH.exe">SETUP_PIANOCHEETAH.exe</a>
<a href="SETUPSHAZWARE.exe">SETUPSHAZWARE.exe</a>

You're on your own with these - I am dooone with windows.
I've fixed a lotta bugs on Linux.  They're all still there on Windows :)
