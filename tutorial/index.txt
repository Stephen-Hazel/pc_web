...my apologies!  i'm still workin on code.

But the idea here is you see the notes in a NICE pianoroll format.

That's been modified with all the nice things standard notation has.

You practice a song.  Or just a track and the song syncs to your playing.

Or you play a "super easy to hit" version of the song with way less notes.

BUT however hard you hit the easy note is how the song's "feel" will go.

Your velocities, super easy notes.

Ok.  Let me get back to coding.  I promise to explain it better.  Maybe with videos.
