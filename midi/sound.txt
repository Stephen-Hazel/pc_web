Ok, you've just done a programchange on channel 1 and picked epiano
 That's a 4, remember?

How the heck does that 4 get you to an epiano sound??

SoundBanks:
Each sound module has a sound bank.
 Sounds are assigned numbers from 0 to the max # of sounds the sound module
 can do.
 0..127 are reserved for standard sounds.
 But if you think you can live with only 128 sounds, you need help.

How many sounds?
My cp-33 has only 16.  But I also use my drumkit's sounds and PianoCheetah's
 SYN.exe (software synthesizer) sounds.

But synthesizer sounds differ...
 - Some have only a handful like my cp-33.

 - Some have only the standard 128.  (See below.)

 - Some have drum sounds, too.

 - Most sound modules have hundreds of sounds.  Some thousands.

 - Some let you modify the sounds.

 - Some let you load in entirely new sounds.

<h3>presets</h3>
in midi, sounds go by several names:
 presets, patches, instruments, program changes, or just sound.

But the numbered <b>slot</b> for a sound is usually called a preset.

So that 4 for epiano means preset #4, slot #4
 that stores what epiano "sounds like"...

When you pick a preset with a programChange control,
 the sound module gets ready:
 - the set of samples used to generate this sound
   Usually a sample per range of notes.
   (If you "stretch" a sample too much it starts sounding bad.)<br>
   Often a sample for each individual note.
   Sometimes a different sample per note per "velocity range".
   (Especially for piano.
   Low velocities use one sample, medium another, hi velocities another.)

 - "settings" that say what the defaults are for
   fx parameters, volume, pan, and other "user configurable" settings:
   envelopes, LFOs, filter cutoff, etc.

 - the set of control mappings that can change the sound.
   (Ex:  modWheel causes vibrato, softer velocity increases filter cutoff)

 - drumkit settings: on channel 10, each note maps to a different drum sound.
   so each note could have all the things I just mentioned.

All of these "sound" parameters lead you to a whole new world.
 The world of sound synthesis.
 There's FM synthesis, additive synthesis, subtractive synthesis.
 Subtractive is the usual one.
 There are lots of good books on this topic.
 And it is a <i>fascinating</i> topic.

But, unfortunately for you, not for now.
