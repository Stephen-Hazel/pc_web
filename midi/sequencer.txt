MIDI starts getting interesting when you introduce a midi
<b>sequencer</b>.

it's a computer program that sits in between your keyboard controller and
 your sound module.  It's usually a program you install on your PC.  But some
 (lame) ones exist on keyboards.  Lame due to their terrible user interface.

It records all the midi events coming in,
 Plays em with "backing tracks" of prerecorded midi events.
 Shows em on the screen in a fancy note/control display.
 Saves and loads the events to a midi file.

Sitting in the middle there, a sequencer can listen to the midi coming from the
 keyboard controller and record it into a "track".

A track is similar to a midi channel, but there's no "16 max" limit on tracks.
 You tell a track to listen to a midi channel (or set of em) and record all
 the notes and controls it hears.

These are played out together (sequenced) with other already recorded tracks.
 You can...
 - display the tracks' notes on screen

 - save em in a .mid file<br>
   (If you need a .WAV or .MP3, install Audacity and have it capture what
    your synthesizers are putting out.)

 - load em from a file

 - edit em on screen

 - add auto accompaniment

 - juggle which track has which sound

 - juggle which tracks go to which sound module channels

The midi sequencer is what gives the keyboard player the capabilities of a
 whole orchestra.  Well, you know, not a real one...
