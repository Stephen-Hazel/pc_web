   <h1>piano practice - how often</h1>


<h3>Step #1</h3><br>
You must find a (not too tough) song that you <b>absolutely love</b> !!<br>
<br>
Your song list is who you are as a piano player.
 If you don't have a song list yet, stop and do that right now.
 Just a list of artist and song title.  Best songs first.
 This is your overall grand plan.  Nothing else is more important.<br>
<br>
You need songs that <i>feel</i> better to you than all other songs.
 Not just a song that you love, but one you could listen to
 over and over and <b>over</b> again.  Because you certainly will.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Finding Time</h3><br>
Aim for every weekday after dinner or something.<br>
<br>
A minimum of 4 days/week, 30 minute sessions might keep you from losing what
 you're working on.  But you want progress.<br>
<br>
Carving half an hour out of your day can be <b>tough</b>.  Make sure you get
 exercise so your brain lasts that long into the evening.<br>
<br>
So schedule it.<br>
On bad days, just quit after doing <b>one</b> thing.
 Take breaks every 10 mins to eat a chocolate, walk a minute and think out loud.<br>
<br>
Your family is <b>not</b> to even talk to you lest they get <b>THE SNAP</b>...
 Oh, they'll learn what that is.
 Interrupt you and cause your beautiful song to crash to a halt...<br>
<br>
<b>AND THEY GET THE SNAP</b> !!<br>
<br>
They shall sit nearby and <b>wait</b> in silence (up to 5 minutes) until you
 complete your thought.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>What playing piano actually is</h3><br>
You're reading rhythms of notes from paper or memory and
 executing body/arm/wrist/finger and foot movements juuust in front of the
 rhythm.<br>
<br>
So you'll need to efficiently read the notation and plan out how those movements
 will make a smooth, expressive sound.<br>
<br>
Piano players use the term "muscle memory" a lot.
 Your brain doesn't plan out individual muscle movements in isolation.
 It plans out whole concerts of muscle movements at a time.
 From brain, to nerve tree, to all muscle sets at once.<br>
<br>
You play a song as a (very) long series of reflexes.<br>
As you practice a song, that sequence of reflexes gets built smoother until
<div class='bul'>it's dead on to make the rhythm happen on time<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>each individual note volume is perfectly hit to sound as you feel it should.<br>
</div><br>
You're doing exactly what a basketball player does when practicing a layup.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Learn While You Sleep</h3><br>
So while you practice, you're only setting yourself up for getting it right.
 You're not actually getting it right until you <b>sleep</b>.<br>
<br>
Sleeping is when your brain rifles through the day's long list of movements
 and decides which ones to jam together into a single reflex.<br>
<br>
Once the reflexes for a song are built (solidly enough), that's when you've
 actually got it right.  Hopefully !!
 So <b>do not</b> play a song less than perfectly.
 Because that'll be the song your brain snapshots.
 And replacing the snapshot takes at least a day of work.<br>
<br>
Thinking about practice is a big part of piano practice.
 Think through where the <b>small tough</b> sections to work on next are.
 Try to <b>feel</b> yourself playing away from piano.<br>
<br>
You also need to plan out how aaaall the note volumes in the song should go.
 Piano playing is an art and this is a big part of how you "paint" the song.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Don't wear yourself out</h3>
 We'll be doing a <b>lot</b> of finger muscle movements during the song.
 It stands to reason that we want to do that with the <b>least</b> amount of
 force possible so they don't get tired.
 You'll see piano players shake out their hands, long exhales, shoulder rolling,
 and so on.<br>
<br>
Play as if you were about to start meditating or yoga.
 Try to get all the stress out and gone.
 Play as "floppy" as possible while still grabbing the right keys.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of grand theories in this area of piano playing.<br>
But most of them boil down to
<div class='bul'>stay loose and fluid<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>as little effort as possible<br>
</div><br>
One good trick:<br>
let's say you're playing the same chord lots of times.
 After each hit, let your fingers relax and slowly move from pretty open to
 fist-ier.  This relaxes your tendons a teeeny bit after each hit.<br>
<br>
Your piano teacher will have more suggestions.<br>
