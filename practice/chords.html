   <h1>piano practice - chords</h1>


You'll see chord symbols above each bar of standard notation.<br>
<br>
It specifies a set of background notes that last roughly a bar.  Maybe a couple
 bars, maybe only a beat.
 These background notes make a slowly moving setting for the melody to kind of
 dance around on top of.  A chord usually has many of the melody notes in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Basic chords:</h3><br>
Chords start with a <b>root</b> note, then extra notes (usually 2)
 are played at the same time.
 Which extra notes?  Depends on the chord's <b>quality</b>.<br>
<pre>
 Quality    Intervals     Notes
 Major      root +4 +7    C E  G
 Minor      root +3 +7    C Eb G
 </pre>
 Those intervals are in "halfsteps".  D to D# is a halfstep.
 C to G is 7 halfsteps.  Count them out on the piano.
 Chords can start on any root note.
 Then you skip the number of halfsteps up to find the rest of the notes in the
 chord quality.<br>
<br>
Chord "root" is the base of the chord.<br>
Chord "quality" is the pattern of halfsteps for the extra notes.<br>
Chord "bass" is the lowest note of a chord.  Often but not always same as root.
 We'll see that a chord's notes' octaves can be <i>anywhere</i>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Interval names</h3>
 There are 12 halfsteps available within an octave (C to next C up).
 Each halfstep distance is an "interval" and has a name.<br>
<pre>
 halfstep    short    interval
 distance    name     name
 0           oct      unison - same dang note
 1           m2       minor 2nd
 2           2        2nd  (sometimes called a major 2nd)
 3           m3       minor 3rd
 4           3        3rd
 5           4        perfect 4th
 6           d5       tritone / augmented 4th / diminished 5th
 7           5        perfect 5th
 8           m6       minor 6th / augmented 5th
 9           6        6th
 10          m7       minor 7th
 11          7        7th<br>

 12          octave (oops, we started over)
             this is the same as unison
 </pre>
 These names are a little confusing but come from the major and minor scales'
 layout.<br>
<br>
A whole step is 2 halfsteps and is handy in defining the major and minor scale
 interval layouts.<br>
<pre>
 Major is  w w h w w w h
          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1
          c d e f g a b c<br>

 Minor is  w h w w w h w
          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1
          a b c d e f g a
 </pre>
 A melody usually sticks to these 7 most popular notes of the key signature.<br>
<br>
Each interval has a characteristic sound.  2 notes ...
<div class='bul'>1 halfstep apart sound pretty grating and terrible.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>a 5th apart sound pretty dang good due to being about a 3rd of an octave
   away from each other.<br>
</div><br>
The octave (unison) interval sounds great.
 It sounds <b>so</b> great, that you can move the octave of <i>any</i>
 chord note to <i>any</i> other octave and you'll still hear the same chord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Octaves don't matter</h3>
 So an interval is a distance and octaves don't matter.
 What happens when we go <b>down</b> a perfect 5th from C?  We get F which is a
 perfect 4th <b>up</b> from the C an octave down.  Since octaves don't matter in
 chords, an interval of a 5th <b>is</b> a 4th with an octave swap.
 Since we can swap octaves, a "5th up" sounds very "4th down".<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Inversion = Arrangement</h3><br>
The <b>octave</b>s of the chord's notes can be anywhere.
 Your ear still hears that chord quality regardless of the notes' octaves.
 It's still the same chord, but in a different "inversion".
 Let's take a C chord:<br>
<pre>
 C4 E4 G4        root position.
    E4 G4 C5     1st inversion.
       G4 C5 E5  2nd inversion.
 (4 note chords can have a 3rd inversion)
 </pre>
 But since you can put those notes in <b>any</b> octave you please,
 referring to "inversions" is mostly only done by piano teachers.
 1st and 2nd inversion are not nearly all the possibilities you've got.<br>
<br>
Piano players say "chord arrangement", giving the root, quality, and
 octave layout.<br>
<br>
Although you <b>can</b> use any octaves, it has to sound good.
 When you play notes too close together in the bass octaves,
 they sound "muddy", sort of overlapping each other - unclean...
 So keep bass notes spread out by an octave, 4th, or 5th in the bass.<br>
<br>
Picking new octaves for chords can improve (and wreck) a song dramatically.
 It's a big part of a song's "arrangement".
 Picking chords and good inversions for them is an art.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Dominant 7th Chord aaand...</h3><br>
Some people just <b>can't</b> be satisfied.  3 Notes?  Not enough for them.
 So we've got "dominant 7th" chords and other chord qualities...<br>
<br>
For an extra (4th note) in the chord, pick an extra note that sounds good.
 A dominant 7th chord is where you take a major chord and add a minor 7th.
 So root +4 +7 +10 (or root,3,5,m7).
 That m7 interval gives you a <i>yearning</i> sound.  It puts you on the edge
 of your seat wanting to hear the next chord.
 Play a G7 then a C  (g dominant 7 chord, then c major chord).
 Sounds pretty great, huh?<br>
<br>
But really, a dominant 7th chord is just another chord quality.
 There are quite a few popular chord qualities...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Mooore Chord Qualities</h3><br>
Jazz is big into naming <b>all</b> of the useful chords.  And some un-useful
 ones.  Here's a pretty decent list of chords and how to make them:<br>

<h3>Altered Chords</h3><br>
Chords can also be <b>tweaked</b> by
<div class='bul'>suspended.  Taking away notes - "suspended 5th".<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>altered.  Changing notes - "altered 3rd".
   If you alter it up a half step, it's "augmented".
   If you alter it down a half step, it's "diminished".<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>added.  Adding notes ("added 6th")<br>
</div><br>
It's a freakin' mess I tell ya !!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Slash Chords</h3><br>
Pop guys just kind of say "who cares what it's called - it sounds GOOD".
 They tack extra notes into the bass via "slash chord" notation.<br>
<br>
So C/D means play a C major and add a D note into the bass.
 Far enough down that the whole thing doesn't sound "muddy".<br>
<br>
Is the D the actual chord root or is the C???
 Pop composers just don't care.
 If it's a chord that sounds good, it's a good chord !!   Play the dang thing.
 Leave categorizing it to the jazz dudes...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Chord Progressions</h3><br>
Going from one chord to the next is called a "chord progression".
 Or, if you're a jazz dude, called "the changes".
 As I mentioned, chords are a <b>slowly</b> moving landscape for a melody
 line to sort of dance on top of.<br>
<br>
So especially in pop music, some songs keep the chords simple (I'm looking at
 you "the blues") and the same sequence of chords is reused from song to song.
 This is great for the listener that doesn't want to have to think.
 Maybe you had a long day.<br>
<br>
Also, keeping the note jumps small when going to the next chord
 makes it sound way better.
 This is called "voice leading" and is too big a topic for right here.<br>
