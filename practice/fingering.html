   <h1>piano practice - fingering</h1>


You've got a lot of notes to play.  Well, which fingers do you use when ??<br>
<br>
Sorry, there are no hard and fast rules for this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In some sheet music, little numbers next to the notes indicate fingering:
 <img style="float:right;" src="fing.png">
 But this is pretty rare.
 Sometimes the given fingering won't work for <b>your</b> fingers.<br>
<br>
You'll have to work it out on your own most the time.
 This is your first job when you pick up a new song.
 Write it <b>down</b> on the notation.  Change it if you find a better way.
 Especially after a good night's sleep<br>
<br>
Watch the min and max range of notes for the section you're on,
 and figure out how you can make your fingers cover them best.<br>
<br>
For chord after chord after chord type sections,
 you'll probably be moving hand positions.<br>
Otherwise, try to keep your hands somewhat stationary so you'll
 know what notes you have <b>under your fingers</b>.<br>
<br>
If possible, try to keep your thumb or your pinky <b>anchoring</b> your hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Tips</h3><br>
(from "Kreisler" of pianoworld.com's forums)<br>

<div class='bul'>Always figure fingering one hand at a time - or you'll drive yourself nuts.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>Determine fingering <b>before</b> practicing.
   You want your brain and fingers to remember <b>one</b> fingering.
   Not a couple variations swapped in and out randomly !!<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>Know what notes are under your fingers so you <b>don't have to look down</b>
   That's why we have black keys.
   So the hand can always <b>feel</b> where it is.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'><b>Don't</b> finger the easy spots.  Clearer is better.
   Do you really need to write that 1 or 5?<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>If the finger doesn't move, don't mark it on the 2nd note.
   just look back across the line.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>For chords, scales and arpeggios try to use standard fingering.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>If possible, anchor your hand via the thumb or pinky and
   keep your fingers on successive keys of the scale to match the music.
   So you can <b>feel intervals</b>.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>When extending to reach a "way out there" note, use either the fingers or
   else the thumb.  Then move it back so you always know what it's covering.
   Try to move either the thumb <b>or</b> the fingers as a group.
   You don't want to have to readjust gaps between the 4 fingers.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>Move your whole hand to a new position rather than <b>stretching</b> fingers.
   But also try to minimize hand hops.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>Try to use your strongest fingers for important notes:
   First thumb, then index, then middle.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>Try to minimize thumbs and pinkies on black notes.
   Since they're short, they'll squish the rest of your fingers up too far.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>Practice thumb under (and 2nd or 3rd over the thumb) for smooth legato
   melodies.
   For very very fast melodies, you'll need to use what's called thumb over,
   but really just means "scoot your whole hand".<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>Pay special attention to smooth transitions between passages of the music.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>Sometimes awkward fingering in an earlier passage "sets up" the start of the
   next passage.<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>Ask your piano teacher how to do it !!<br>
</div><br>
<br>
Lots of rules.  None set in stone.  If it's smooth, relaxed, and sounds good,
 it is good.<br>
