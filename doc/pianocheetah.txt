pianocheetah main directory has...
 - YOUR songs - the ones you're practicing and did.

 - Parts of songs, midi device configuraton, and other stuffff.


Don't keep every midi file in the universe here!  
Keep those in a different directory to be searched.
PianoCheetah lists this one every time it runs.


<h3>1_learning</h3>
songs you're learning right now (daily-ish)


<h3>2_repertoire</h3>
songs you want to keep in your fingers (weekly-ish) on rotation


<h3>3_done</h3>
songs you're done with but want to keep because of the loops and fingering you've setup.  So you can pick them back up another day


<h3>4_queue</h3>
staging area for new songs you'll get to as you have time.
eventually they'll be moved to 1/2/3 above...


<h3>clip</h3>
parts of tracks that are weaved into songs
drum clips, bass patterns, arpeggios, chord changes, styles, etc


<h3>device</h3>
has your midi hardware configuration and all of syn's samples


<h3>midi_import</h3>
If you have a whole bunch of midi files to convert to .song format,
 put them here.
When PCheetah starts, they'll all be converted and moved to 4_queue.

directory structure is important:
genre/groupArtist/title
If groupArtist is ^ then the first space, -, or _ will be used to split group and title
If groupArtist is @ then group is split off the end of the filename.
Use _ for unknown groupArtist
Genre should almost always be _Pop but categorize as you like.
 
TODO explain better :/
