pianocheetah main directory has...
 - YOUR songs - the ones you're practicing and did.

 - Parts of songs, midi device configuraton, and other stuffff.


Don't keep every midi file in the universe here!  
Keep those in a different directory to be searched.
PianoCheetah lists this one every time it runs.


<h3>1_learning</h3>
songs you're learning right now (daily-ish)


<h3>2_repertoire</h3>
songs you want to keep in your fingers (weekly-ish) on rotation


<h3>3_done</h3>
songs you're done with but want to keep because of the loops and fingering you've setup.  So you can pick them back up another day


<h3>4_queue</h3>
staging area for new songs you'll get to as you have time.
eventually they'll be moved to 1/2/3 above...


<h3>clip</h3>
parts of tracks that are weaved into songs
drum clips, bass patterns, arpeggios, chord changes, styles, etc


<h3>device</h3>
has your midi hardware configuration and all of syn's samples


<h3>midi_import - How do I get new midi files in this thing??</h3>
pianocheetah looks for midi files here when it boots.

 - it will also re-convert .mid files to .song files if there's a 
   .../pianocheetah/4_queue/redo.txt file

 - any non midi files are moved to a dir called midi_junk
   (like .txt files or .pdf or whatever else)

 - directory structure will be kept when moving to 4_queue
