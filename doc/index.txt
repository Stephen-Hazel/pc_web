the stuff ta lookup when you're all "how did pianocheetah do that again??"

Still super beta !!  I work on it every week though.


OK!  A blurb about PianoCheetah's main purpose:

 - piano and drum song practice.

 - show notes in NICE pianoroll format.  Better than standard notation.  Not jokin'

 - you practice a song.  Or just a track and the rest syncs to your playing.

 - or you play a "super easy to hit" version of the song with way less notes. 
   BUT however hard you hit the easy note is how the song's "feel" will go.

 - NOT a daw!! - there are enough of those.  we're not here to mix down.  ...yet

 - getting a song into your head and fingers is what we're about here.  


Ok.  Let me get back to coding.  I promise to explain it better.  Maybe with videos.
