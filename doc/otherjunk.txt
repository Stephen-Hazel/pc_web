Steve's notes ta remember.  Sorry.  It's in Stephen-eze.

<h3>TrkEZ:</h3>
<pre>
   if 2 tracks, store times where both hands hit in sam [ns]
   per track:
      get times,pseudodurs between em
      mark grace notes w super short durs in seq (1,2,3etc)
         kill a sam[] if not 1st grc note in seq
      10 reps to find best "common" rhythms:
         find poss with max len and max gots (longest rhy + #reps)
            (compare w ngot*len)
      kill a sam[] if within rhythm
      add notes with reset to finger 1 when grace,rhythm startsm
   bring in sam[] times to finger 1 n cascade till next grc/rhy start
      UNLESS doin that would make a 11 at start or end of recascade
