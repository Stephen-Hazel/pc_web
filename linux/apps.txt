Here's a list of the apps I like:

- kde's kdenlive for video editings

- SimpleScreen Recorder for screen video capture

- notepadpp for editing big wide text files that NEd can't handle

- kde's dolphin for my file explorer

- chrome

- filezilla for sftp

- 'disk usage analyzer' to see what's eatin your disk
  called baobab if you can't find 'disk usage analyzer'
