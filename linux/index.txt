I'll be talkin bout

- installing it

- finding some good apps

- setting up a dev env (if you code)

- distributing on linux (also if you code)

I've been on a lotta ancient PCs and windows.

Windows was great from win98 to 7.
But it sucked at win8.  
Like enough to move to linux.

It took me a while, but now I'm happy on kubuntu and raspi.

Linux ain't yet ready for your gramma.  But it's ready for you.

Ok.  Let's install a linux.
