   <h1>bout linux - coding</h1>


Before you code, you need to:<br>
<br>
- decide between Qt and GTK.  (Qt sucks way less!)
  <br>
- Now you can setup your dev environment - qtcreator
  <a href='install_kubuntu.html'>Here's how i install it</a><br>
<br>
Don't just stick with command line coding.<br>
If there's one think linux needs it's GUI apps that don't suck.<br>
<br>
<br>
These distribution instructions are for me.  take from them what you will.<br>
<a href='/'>naw, we're done here - back home please :)</a><br>
<br>
<br>
This may surprise you, but on linux, the usual way you install an app is<br>
1) install a replacement OS on top of your distro.<br>
2) rewrite your app to run on this os instead of the distro os.<br>
3) bundle it all up and distribute.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why?  Because you can't take an executable on one distro and run it on another.<br>
Unless the linux you compiled on and the one you hope to run on are very very similar.<br>
<br>
Why?  Typically, distros pick a big network of .so files (runtime libraries - called .dll on windows).<br>
Once they're picked, eeeverything the distro plans to run is compiled using those exact .so versions.<br>
<br>
Got an app that didn't come with the distro?  Prepare for a headache.<br>
Got the source for that app?  And the dev env for the app?<br>
You can compile and link it with the distro's .so libraries.<br>
<br>
Otherwise you're probably out of luck because the distros do not use a common set of .so files.<br>
This will cause apps compiled on distro1 to be missing needed .so files on distro2.<br>
<br>
WHY???  I DON'T KNOW!!!  Seems pretty duuuuuumb to me !<br>
If all the distros decided on a standard set of .sos, everything would be fine.<br>
<br>
My hope is that this happens BEFORE the distros throw up their hands and rewrite their<br>
OS code on top of those (DUMB!) mini os environments.<br>
Cuz that will mean we're stuck with them forever.<br>

<br>
<br>
So what I do is use .deb files for my releases.<br>
It's what sudo apt uses behind the scenes.<br>
But you're limited to a distro based on debian<br>
(like ubuntu, kubuntu, chromeos' included debian, raspi).<br>
<br>
Well that'll (hafta) work for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
install .deb in chromeos by
 doubleclicking .deb in Files app<br>
<br>
<br>
<d> below is top dir in name format app_version-revis_arch
 version is yyyymmdd.
 revis always 1.
 arch is amd64 or armhf.
 (my preferences, of course)<br>
<br>
<app> below is the dirname for your app
 (shazware for my example)<br>
<br>
install:   sudo dpkg -i <d>.deb
           sudo dpkg -i shazware_20220514-1_amd64.deb<br>
remove:    sudo dpkg -P <dprefix>
           sudo dpkg -P shazware<br>
<br>
<br>
CREATING A .deb ...<br>
<br>
sudo apt install dpkg  (probably already there)<br>
<br>
mkdir -p <d>/opt/app/<app><br>
mkdir    <d>/DEBIAN<br>
cp <all exe .png .desktop etc> to
   <d>/opt/app/<app>/<br>
cp <all .desktop> to
   <d>/usr/share/applications<br>
vi <d>/DEBIAN/control with...<br>
Package: shazware<br>
Version: 20220514<br>
Architecture: amd64  (or armhf for raspi)<br>
Maintainer: Stephen Hazel<stephen.hazel@gmail.com> https://pianocheetah.app<br>
Description: shazware - Stephen HAZel’s softWARE
 and an extra long description starting with space
 ned - Nifty text EDitor
 ftx - Find TeXt in files under a directory
 flatten - flatten all dirs/files under a directory to dirs_files
 undup - kill off dup files based on contents matching exactly<br>
Section: custom<br>
Priority: optional<br>
Essential: no<br>
Installed-Size: (size of exe in bytes)<br>
Sources:<br>
Depends:<br>
<dependencies appended here><br>
<br>
Taking care of external dependencies:<br>
copy <d> to a linux drive that can handle diff case diff file (NTFS won’t)<br>
cd <d><br>
cp -pr DEBIAN debian
   (you may have to do this on a drive that CAN DO dirs of same name diff case)<br>
ln -s opt/app/<app> x<br>
dpkg-shlibdeps -v -O x/<exe1> x/<exe2> ...etc<br>
copy the last line into your DEBIAN/control file<br>
rm -fr debian<br>
rm x<br>
<br>
dpkg-deb --build --root-owner-group <d><br>
NOW stick that <d>.deb on your website<br>
(WITH the top couple lines about how TF to install/remove/etc)<br>
...aaand see who whines<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
<br>
test remove:
 dpkg -l | grep <d>
 output should be blank if uninstalled correctly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Run scripts before or after package installation and removal<br>
<d>/DEBIAN/preinst
   postinst
   prerm
   postrm<br>
are called maintainer scripts.<br>
must be chmod between 0555 and 0775.<br>
<br>
<br>
When installing, if you see
 Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should reinstall it before attempting a removal.<br>
Then
 keep anything you want preserved then
 sudo mv /var/lib/dpkg/info/<d>.* /tmp/
 sudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq <d><br>
<br>
<br>
dpkg-gencontrol writes names of package files into "debian/files".<br>
Parsing it much easier than any dances with resulting files in parent directory<br>
(i.e. parsing ../*.changes").<br>
<br>
<br>
.desktop files:
 usually in /usr/share/applications
 or ~/.local/share/applications
 else:
 create an ‘applications’ directory somewhere
 put your .desktop files
 add path of it’s parent directory to the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable<br>
