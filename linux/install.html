   <h1>bout linux - install</h1>


Your first question is gonna be "which distro???"<br>
<br>
I'd recommend kubuntu.  I don't know you tho.<br>
Start with kubuntu and try others later.<br>
Starting turns out to be more important than picking the right distro.<br>
<br>
Also get a raspberry pi!  They're teeny and cheap and wonderful.<br>
<br>
Now ya gotta "burn an iso".  That's dumb linux speak for<br>
take a linux distro's os image file and write it to a usb stick.<br>
<br>
To install onto some old pc you have lying around.<br>
Don't dual boot.  windows and linux should never share a disk!<br>
Unless you like to be annoyed every time you boot your pc.<br>
Buy another pc.  They're cheap.<br>
<br>
<br>
balenaEtcher is a good app for writing the distro's .iso file to usb stick.<br>
<a rel='x' href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">here</a><br>
<br>
For the raspberry pi, you'll want to use it's dedicated "imager".<br>
Stick with whatever it's default iso is.  Currently a 32 bit version.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then you fiddle with your pc's bios settings so<br>
your usb stick is found in the boot drive list.<br>
Your pc probably tells you which key to hold down on boot in order to <br>
get into the bios settings.<br>
Usually F2, F1, Esc or Del.<br>
Then work your way to where you pick the drives to boot from and<br>
add your usb to it.<br>
<br>
Then reboot and wait.<br>
You'll usually see the "live os".<br>
The distro running ONLY for "try it" purposes - but not yet installed.<br>
<br>
There'll be an install icon to double click and it'll ask you the usual stuff:<br>

<div class='bul'>replace the whole hard drive?  Yes!<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>machine and user name?  always name your machine penguin and
   use your 2 initials for userid<br>
</div>
<div class='bul'>put in your dang wifi password if ya ain't got an ethernet line
   (like you should)<br>
</div><br>
<br>
Ok.  Go to the settings app and tweak away.<br>
Linux requires a lot of SUPER ANNOYING tweaking that you should write down for<br>
the next time you install the distro.<br>
<br>
Here's what I wrote down for <br>
<a href='install_kubuntu.html'>kubuntu</a> and <br>
<a href='install_raspi.html'>raspi</a><br>
<br>
After that hump, you're ready to install your apps and setup your dev env.<br>
<br>
Oh and hardware wise, I like a NUC with an i7 and 2 hdmi ports or<br>
else video over usb3 capability.<br>
<br>
The raspi has 2 hdmi ports, but no video over usb3.<br>
<br>
I keep my data on a synology NAS.<br>
And backup to a usb3 drive.<br>
<br>
And all my network, usb, and (TONS o) midi devices hang off the usb3 hub.<br>
Then the hub is swapped between kubuntu and raspi.<br>
And i have 2 hdmi switches to swap between kubuntu and raspi<br>
so both get my portrait monitor (coding) and TV (browsing).<br>
<br>
<br>
Now which apps to use on linux...  Hmmm...<br>
<br>
