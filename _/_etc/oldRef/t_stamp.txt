<h1>Tinkerer - Track Stamper</h1>
<pre>

   knits together a track from single bar "snippet"s according to a "pattern".
      and kicks PianoCheetah.

   Sometimes you just want a simple drum track to record over.
   Sometimes you just want a click track.
   TrackStamper does that.

   <img src="img/tstamp.png">

   The default pattern is
      an intro bar ("i" is a 4 click count in bar) followed by
      24 reps of [a b a b a b a c]

      where a..j are single track .mid or .txt files.

      You pick which snippets to use for a, b and c with the a..j droplists.

   If "Play via PianoCheetah" is checked,
      well, you can guess what happens...
      Might want to leave it unchecked while adjusting lots of stuff :)

   I've included some demo drum bar clips in this archive
      in the ...\PianoCheetahSongs\SongClip\Drum\Pat and \Fill directories.
      They are in my .txt format   (see Txt2Mid reference docs)

   Unfortunately, Tinkerer doesn't REMEMBER which patterns you used if you
      go back into TrackStamper.
      That's on the "to do" list...:/
