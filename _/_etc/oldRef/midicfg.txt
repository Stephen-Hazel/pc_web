<h1>Use MidiConfiger to set up your midi devices</h1>

SETUP_PIANOCHEETAH.exe will start MidiConfiger.
or get to it by PianoCheetah's "black midi plug" toolbar button.

Here's an (old - sorry) screenshot:

If you have Vista or Win7,
   please wait for it to download my soundfont softsynth.  (Sorry - 35 megs:)

Name and order your midi devices.  Keep names short and sweet.
I named my keyboards "dude" and "rockin88".
A digital piano has both a
   midiIn  (keyboard controller) -and-
   midiOut (sound synthesizer).
So give 'em the same name if they're the same device.

Scoot the devices up and down into the order you wish to use them.
Click on a line then the up/down toolbar arrows.

Set the "junky" devices to devicetype = OFF
That Microsoft synth uses laaaame 22KHz samples and has terrible latency.

If you ever install/uninstall midi devices,
click the little refresh toolbar button to add/remove devices that are new/gone.

For now, we just leave all the devicesType as DEFAULT

<h1>Test your devices.</h1>
Can you hear me now???  good...

<h3>Input test:</h3>
Press any midi key or control, and it should show up in the right side
   of MidiConfiger giving the device name and note/control info.
Hit some keys, tweak pitchbend, modwheel, stomp some pedals...
   It may look cryptic, but as long as you see STUFF coming in...
good.

<h3>Output test:</h3>
Click on a MidiOut device, click that play button in bottom right.
It should play a little scale.
Do check that MS Window's "volume control panel" ain't muted, etc.
PianoCheetah's softsynth <b>takes over</b> the sound device to get good latency.

<h1>Set the CommandNote:</h1>
The top midiin device in MidiConfigerer has the <b>CommandNote</b>.
Set the highest note that keyboard has in the
Pianocheetah global config dialog (world under checkmark button).

Holding the top note on your midi keyboard will make PianoCheetah
"do" stuff when you hit certain MIDI keys like:
   adjust tempo,  pick next song,  hop to a new loop,  save recording, etc.

PianoCheetah will pop a window listing the commands:
(Sorry, this is really old, too.)

When that CommandNote is released, help window shuts and notes play as usual.
Remember, only that key of the <b>top</b> MidiIn device does this.
