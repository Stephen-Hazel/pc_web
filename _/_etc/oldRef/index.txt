<h1>And here's a junky one page explanation of other stuff :/</h1>
<br><pre>

Tinkerer
   shows the midi file in typical piano roll notation.
   Eventually, everything in here will move to PianoCheetah.
   It names, tests, configures and organizes your midi devices.

Mid2Wav
   Right click a midi file in Windows Explorer and pick
   "Convert to WAV".
   Turns your .MID (plus your .WAV instruments) into an output .WAV
   to put on the web, give to your Mom, etc.
   Done withOUT playing it live (quickly:)

WavPlayer
   lets you listen to a TON of .WAV files at once.
   but just plays them (and lists freq, bits, stereo/mono, etc).
   Use it to preview a big dir of .WAV files to see
   if they're worth beans.
   Right click a directory of .WAV files in Windows Explorer and pick
   "Play WAVs"

Waver
   shows samples of a .WAV file pretty well.
   can't edit the samples, but WILL edit params of the .WAV
   like loop points, frequency, sampled note, etc.
   Right click a .WAV file in Windows Explorer and pick
   "Edit with Waver"

Sounder
   what I use to make a sound.txt file for a new device type.

RepRpt
   currently broke :(  Creates a repertoire report for ya
   once I stitch it back together again.
