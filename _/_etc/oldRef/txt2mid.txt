<h1>Txt2Mid - converting Steve's .TXT song file format to a .MID file</h1>
<pre>

Once you've got your .TXT files setup in the format described below,
   right click it in Windows Explorer and pick either
   "Play with PianoCheetah"  or  "Edit with Tinkerer"

   (Txt2Mid is used "behind the scenes")


When I first tried out a sequencer called Bars&Pipes for my
   ooooooooole Amiga 500, I was kind of upset that I had to "click" in sheet
   music if I wanted to get the sequencer to play it.

   Click the "add" tool, Click the quarter note duration,
   find out where middle C was on the display and Click it,
   Click this.  Click that.  Sheesh!

   I wanted a "text file music format" so I could TYPE in sheet music.
   So I came up with one and a program that converts it to midi.

   One top level song.txt file includes other .txt files per track
      in it's same directory or in
      ...\PianoCheetahSongs\SongClip\... dirs
      (You can put any common tracks in the SongClip dir like drum patterns)

   Also, repeating sections can be typed in just ONCE.

song Example:

</pre><pre class="fix">
   Use PianoCheetah's leftmost toolbar button to get to the songpack downloader.
   Download the "_Txt" song pack and check out
   ...\PianoCheaterSongs\Do\_Txt\Nushooz_CantWait\
         _CantWait_song.txt
         drum.txt
         lh.txt

         vocal.txt
         bass_a.txt
         bass_b.txt
         bass_c.txt


Take a look at _CantWait_song.txt:
         !name=drum                    track name
         $cd@fga@                      scale (flatten e and b)
         !Tmpo=120
         #Drum                         load in drum track's notes
         NextTrack                     NEXT !!
         --                            (comment)
         !name=lh
         !sound=Bass\Syn1              pick the sound
         #lh                           load in left hand track's nots
         NextTrack
         --
         !name=rh                      ditto for RH
         !sound=SynLead\Sawtooth
         #rh
         NextTrack
         --
         -- markers in here
         !name=vocal                   vocal track
         !sound=SynLead\Voice
         #Vocal
         --
         unroll                        now "unroll" the sections into the
         intro                            whole song (dup'ing some sections)
         verse
         chorus
         bridge1
         intro                         use this guy again, etc...
         verse
         chorus
         bridge2
         coda
         coda

         So we have 4 tracks: lh (bass), rh, vocal, and Drum.
________________________________________________________________________________

Drum.txt in turn has the drum track referencing the drum clips...

         ------- intro
         -- 8 bars of drums in ABABABAC pattern using rock 5,7,fill9
         #Drum\Pat\1\Rock\05
         #Drum\Pat\1\Rock\07
         #Drum\Pat\1\Rock\05

         #Drum\Pat\1\Rock\05
         #Drum\Fill\1\Rock\09
         ------- verse
         #Drum\Pat\1\Rock\05
         #Drum\Pat\1\Rock\07
         #Drum\Pat\1\Rock\05

         #Drum\Pat\1\Rock\05
         #Drum\Pat\1\Rock\07
         #Drum\Pat\1\Rock\05
         #Drum\Fill\1\Rock\09
         ...etc...
________________________________________________________________________________

...\PianoCheetahSongs\SongClip\Drum\Pat\1\Rock\05.txt (for example) in turn has:
         --- Rock 5
         s kick      hhcl
         s
         s kick      hhcl
         s
         s      snar!hhcl!
         s
         s kick      hhcl
         s
         s           hhcl
         s
         s kick      hhcl
         s
         s      snar!hhcl!
         s
         s kick      hhcl
         s

         s means sixteenth note
         kick turns into the standard midi note of 2b
         (octave 2 note b maps to kick in general midi's standard drum map)
         hhcl maps to 3f#, etc.
         ! means play the note at max velocity (127 instead of normal=100)
________________________________________________________________________________

After the full drum track is built, there's a
   NextTrack  command to, well, start the next track, derrr...

   We do the left hand piano track next.
   It uses 3 one bar bass patterns (bass_a, bass_b and bass_c.txt)
   Then right hand piano track and finally the vocal track.

   For example, right.txt has...

         !vol=80
         ---------------------------------------- intro 1
         e 4b,   h eg
         e b
         e 5d
         e c
         e 4gb,  q e
         s 5c
         s 4g
         e
         e b
         ----------
         e  4b,  q.s df
         e  b
         e  5d
         s  c
         sq 4dfgb
         e
         e  b
         ---------- 3
         ...etc...


   !vol=80
      means set volume control to 80  (of 127)
      and then we start the notes (remembering the scale we set)

   e 4b, h eg
      means play an eighth note on octave 4 note b    (oct 4 has middle c in it)
         (which will be flatted to 4a#=4b@(flat) per our scale)
      and at the same time start a half note with e and g  (same octave)

   in general, lines start with a Duration then OctaveNote.

   A trailing comma means that another note group starts at the same time
   with a different (usually longer) duration

   our leftmost duration was an eighth so
   the next line down's note starts RIGHT after that eigth
      (while the e and g keep sustaining for a bit).

   The articulation for the note defaults to leggerio (3/4 the full duration).
   You can set the default articulation (effecting ALL following notes, too) to
      staccato < (1/4 dur)
      portato  = (1/2 dur)
      leggerio > (3/4 dur - the default if ommitted) or
      legato   - (full dur)

   I tend to put -- lines at the bar boundaries
      and number the bars at the beginning of a line (row?) of sheet music
      (in the left margin on the sheet, and to right of -- bar marker)
________________________________________________________________________________

In the vocal track you'll find lines like:
         !vol=80
         ---------------------------------------- intro 1
         !marker=intro
         w
         w
         w
         w
         w
         w
         w
         ----------
         h
         e
         s 4b
         s b
         e b
         e, q- g
         ---------------------------------------- verse 9
         !marker=verse
         e
         e b
         q
         h
         ----------
         ...etc...

         Note the marker lines that say HEY!  At =this= time,
            section "intro" starts (and goes until next marker)

         This tells unroll how to duplicate the sections correctly.


So when you right click _CantWait_song.txt and pick "Play with PianoCheetah",
   you'll have yourself a full fledged song !!

Snippet examples:

                   assume that the scale is...
   $cd@fga@        will flatten all E and B notes:  @=flat, #=sharp

   q 4ceg          makes a minor chord on middle C (e is flattened by scale)
                   played for a quarter note duration
                   with leggerio articulation
                                    (note is released 3/4 way thru the duration)

   q ce%g          makes a major chord
                   % suffix on a note makes it natural - overrides the scale

   h.e.- 4b%       makes a middle octave B  (no flatting from the scale)
                   with a duration of a dotted half plus dotted eighth
                   with a legato articulation (-)
                               (note isn't released until full duration is over)
   h- 4e
   h  d            make a slurred middle E flat (cuzu the scale)  to middle D
                   The E@ is played at time 0
                      with a half note duration
                      with legato articulation
                   The D is played after a half note and will sound RIGHT
                                                                    after the E@
                      with a half note duration
                      with leggerio articulation


   Note that the "start time" of each notegroup is determined by
   the duration of the FIRST (leftmost) notegroup in each line

   If you have notes that have durations that cross measures you may want to go:

   h     4fa5c
   h, h. 4ce%g
   -- next note starts while prev measure's c chord has only played for half dur
   h     5c
________________________________________________________________________________

   chords:
   you can use simple chords, too (no inversions or suspensions for now - sorry)
   a trailing + for major,
              +- minor, ++ aug, +* dim,
              +7 dom7, +7- min7, +7+ maj7
              +6 6th, ...
   examples:
   q 4c+      will play a major chord rooted at middle c for a quarter note
   w 4c+7     will do a dominant 7th over middle c for a whole note
   fingering syntax...:)
________________________________________________________________________________

   add a [fingering] right after note
   q 4c[1]e[3]g[5]      will put little fingering numbers by the note
   q 4c[23]             press with finger2 and hold with finger3
                        (thumb is finger 1 of either hand .. pinky is 5)
   (or just use PianoCheetah and click em in)

Full Syntax:

   I tried to make this notation as flexible as sheet music is
   so the format is a bit complex.
   (although limitations ARE there.  Esp note velocity, etc)



-
lines starting with the '-' character are comments.  They're ignored.


#
lines starting with the '#' character mean to include the named .txt file.
ex:  #drum 80     will include the drum.txt file 80 times


other lines are note event lines in this format:
    [this means optional]  {this means 0 or many}  (this means 1 or many)

notegroup[,notegroup]

notegroup    = duration {frequency}

duration     = [rolled](value[modifier])[articulation]

$
lines starting with the '$' character define the scale and default articulation
   for example...
$##e###b<          will make all C,D,F,G and A notes into C#,D#,F#,G# and A# and
                   the default articulation stacatto
$cd@fga@>          will make all E and B notes into Eb and Bb (umm, flat) and
                   the default articulation leggerio

!
lines starting with the '!' character are control change events
for example...
!Vol=100
!PBnd=64
!Tmpo=120      (in BPM - which is actually defined as QUARTER NOTES per minute)
               (BPM ignores what the timesig says our beat is - by definition)
!TSig=6/8
!Hold=64

Here are all the controls:
   Prog, Prss, PBnd,
   Vol,  Expr, Pan,  Bal,
   Mod,  Brth, Pedl,
   Hold, Hld2, Soft, Sust, Lega,
   Sld1, Sld2, Sld3, Sld4,
   Btn1, Btn2, Btn3, Btn4,
   Tmpo

Duration breakout (for those into gory detail - timing 'ticks' per duration)
    normal  dotted=.  triplet=3

Ok, that's it for Txt2Mid (finally)
