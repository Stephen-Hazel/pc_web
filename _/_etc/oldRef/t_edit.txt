<h1>Tinkerer - editing</h1>
<pre>

Using Tinkerer to click in a drum track  (and note editing in general)

Start Tinkerer:
<img src="img/tinker2.png">

First off, you need to tell Tinkerer which
   tracks and controls and drums (oh my!) to let you edit.
   Click the "Edit Track, Drum, and Control lists" button  (rightmost one).
   to see...
   <img src="img/tinker_lst.png">

Add Track:
   Click in the track area.
   Click the "Insert line" button (leftmost one).
   fill in a TrackName: and
   set Sound: to Drum\Drum (very topmost in list)
         Note that Sound possibilities will change if Device is changed.

Add Drums:
   Click in the Drum area.
   Click the "Insert line" button.
      You'll get a default (first available) drum.
      Click the droplist and pick HHOp (hihat cymbal open)
   3 more times to get:
      HHCl (closed)
      Snar (snare drum)
      Kick (bass drum)


Click in notes via the mouse:
   Okay, we're done with that dialog so close it.
   We're back in the main screen now...

   You must have ONLY ONE track selected in the Track: droplist to edit notes.

   Click the Snap: droplist and pick 1/16.

   Regular mouse button over an empty spot starts dragging in a note.
      The note will have the note on and off velocities shown in top/right
                                                                  edit controls.
   Clicking over an existing note moves the note's On or Off time.
      Depending over which half of the note you clicked.

   When the note area HAS FOCUS (the => rectangle is GREEN),
      Hovering over the left 3rd of a note,
                  the mouse scroll wheel edits note on velocity.
      Hovering over right 3rd of a note edits note off velocity.
      Hoverer over middle 3rd to choose fingering for a note.

      Yes, you CAN edit fingering :)


Put in some DRUMs:
   Put a 16th note on Kick on beats 1 and 3 of the 1st bar.
      on Snar on beats 2 and 4.
      on HHCl on every 16th note except the last.
      On HHOp on the last 16th note of the bar.

   Click the * toolbar button to select everything
      (See the bracketting red lines?)
   Hover over the 2nd bar.
   And move up into the toolbar area being careful not to hover over other bars.

   Click the green plus to copy the 1st bar into a 2nd bar.
   Click *
   Hover over the 3rd bar.
   Click +

   Now you'll have 4 bars (etc, etc).

   Click *, Click the note button to play it in PianoCheetah.


Erase stuff:
   ...by dragging a rectangle with the RIGHT (other) mouse button.

   By default this deletes notes inside.
   You can pick from the Mov: droplist to instead
      move the notes to another track.

   Sorry, but I don't yet have group modification of stuff :(
      The idea is that you'll move the set of events you want to mess with
      to an "extra" track.  (bouncing tracks...)
      Mess with em there.  Then move em back to the original track.
   Got ideas about how to set up a better user interface?  I'm all ears!!
                                                    Click blue feedback thingy=>

Editing Controls:
   Clicking in the control area on an existing control event will update it.
      Else, you'll get a new control event.
      (careful of Snap:)
   Add new control TYPES the same way you added new drums
      - in that 1st dialog we used.

Trim the song:
   Hover over the first bar you want.
   click the [ toolbar button.
   Same with the ] toolbar button.
   click the red X to trash everything between.
