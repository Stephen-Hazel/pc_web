SYN can have a =huge= number of .WAV files to use.

Well, PianoCheetah doesn't want to have to constantly sort that MONDO directory.
   So it does that ONLY IF something has changed.
   (checked when PianoCheetah loads a midi file.)

This is done by checking the dates of the dirs within ...\device\syn
   and comparing to ...\device\syn\sound.txt's date.

Unfortunately, if you change a file DEEP within that folder,
Windows seems to not always update the parent folders' dates :(

Sooooooo, rename one of the top level folders and rename it back.
That'll change the date.  And I'll try to think of a better way...:(

Sound sorting is done by...
   sound group (keyboard, orchestral, bass, soundfx, drums)
   sound directory
   rating (if a sound starts with a_ or b_ or c_ it sorts above others)
   name
