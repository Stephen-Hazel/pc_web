<h1>PianoCheetah - adding lyrics to your songs</h1>

There are tons of lyrics websites out there.  Yay!
I started out with PianoCheetah hilighting syllables.
But it's <b>way</b> too much of a pain to enter syllables in.  Yuck!

So it's a line at a time now.
Just copy the text from one of those lyric websites and put bars in the start
of each line.

PianoCheetah has a global config (click "world behind checkmark" toolbar button)
that you can check that'll put the current bar onto the clipboard as the
song ticks along.

Load up those lyrics in your favorite text editor.
Start PianoCheetah playing the midi file.
When the lyric is <em>juuuust</em> about to start, press control-V when
your cursor is at the start of the line to jam the bar# into the front.

Put LYRIC in the first line of the file.
Save the .txt file somewhere (just in case).

Uncheck PianoCheetah's "copy bar to clipboard" thingy.

In the text editor, Press control-A and then control-C to put the whole
thing into the clipboard.

Reload your song in PianoCheetah - BAM - it has lyrics now.
Change songs - BAM - it's saved.



You're done.  Thank you.  Thank you.
