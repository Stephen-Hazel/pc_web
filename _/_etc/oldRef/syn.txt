<h1>SYN - PianoCheetah's software [SYN]thesizer</h1>

turns notes (midi) into audio
  according to the .WAV instrument sounds you've got.

Needs Windows Vista,7,8, or better.  <em>Please</em> replace that old XP pc.
If you only have XP, you'll need to use your midi keyboard's sounds.
They're possibly better, anyways.

SYN uses the lowest latency your soundcard says it can handle (so no config).

It'll load any .WAV file you got.  It becomes a sound you can use from midi.
That includes full stereo mixes at 32 bit, 96MHz.  It's now a midi instrument.
That also includes 8 bit mono soundtracker samples.
________________________________________________________________________________

I'm pretty proud of SYN.  Everything is written from scratch in C++.
Unfortunately, SYN is still in it's infancy.
But it does filter, volume adjust, pan, and mix multisampled .WAV files
with effects.

It doesn't come with a full general midi set of sounds.
You're gonna have to find those on the web and add 'em in.

SYN has no GUI yet :/
If you want to know:
 - if samples are failing to load
 - how much polyphony you're using (it'll do 128:)
 - if distortion is affecting your max mix level (making things too quiet)
You'll unfortunately need <a rel="x" href=

In most synthesizers, there's a "patch format" that specifies all the
envelope, LFO, modulation, effects parameters (among tons of other parameters)
These are applied to a limited list of samples.

SYN does things a teeny bit differently.

A sound starts as either a single .WAV file or a directory of .WAV files.
   (Multisampled over a range of notes and optionally velocities, too.)
It can be looped, or not.  Stereo or Mono.
Any resolution of bits and frequency <em>should</em> work.
Email me if not.

When a sample is loaded, it's converted to double floating point precision.
and scaled between -1.0 and 1.0.

Upon noteDown,
   the Key sets the frequency (unless it's a drum .WAV).
   Velocity sets amplitude and filter cutoff.
   (key and velo also pick which sample of the multisample gets used.)

Upon noteUp,
   a short ramp is applied to amplitude to bring it to 0, then note is shut off.

Upon control changes,
   Vol - adjusts amplitude.
   Pan - adjusts balance.
   VCut - adjusts filter cutoff.
      0 is default meaning filter cutoff is high for low velocities.
      1 and up decreases the amount of filter cutoff.
      127 means use whatever the cut control has in it.
   Cut - (can) set filter cutoff directly.
   Res - sets filter resonance amount
   PBnd and PBnR - adjust frequency with noteDown key
   Chor and Rvrb - set amount of effects.
   chorus controls:  cNr, cLevel, cSpeed, cDepth, cType
   reverb controls:  rRoom, rLevel, rWidth, rDamp
   rPan and roto control a rotary speaker effect, but still need MUCH work :(

When mixing,
   the mix is always scaled to -1.0 and 1.0 before sending samples out.
   this can mean volume goes low if effects make the mix screechy and
      overall amplitude shoots up.  Instead of distortion, things get quieter.
      This is reset upon "reset all controls".

You can add any .WAV files you've got to SYN !

Unfortunately, the directory you toss these .WAV files into is buried pretty
deep thanks to the dumb way Windows stores application specific files...:/

You have to dig to:
   c:\Users\[yourUserID]\AppData\Roaming\PianoCheetah\device\syn\<...whew>

Sorry about that, I'll think of some way to make it nicer in a future release.
MidiConfigerer will open a windows explorer window there for ya.

But all ya do is find good .WAV files and plop em in a directory.
You could pile them all in one directory, but try to keep to the existing
General Midi directories syn already has so that the sound will make
a track of a midi file USING it map back to the correct general midi
patch number.

If you have a multisample, make a directory who's name ends in .WAV.
Look at existing samples in the Drum and Piano directories.
NO SPACES IN THOSE multisample directory names !
PianoCheetah expects sound paths/names to not have spaces.
SynSound will automatically rename .WAV -files- so spaces become _s.
But it won't do that for directories !!  (yet - sorry:)

If the .WAV files of a multisample aren't set to the right sampled key,
You can rename the .WAV files with the note as the name's suffix.
If it's a velocity multisample, use _v999 suffix after the note (or at end).
If it's a mono sample you want to use with another .WAV to make a stereo
sample, the filename should end in _R or _L.wav.
________________________________________________________________________________

Where can you find good .WAV files?
There are tons of em on the internet:

You can also get (low quality) samples from .MOD files :)
Right click a .MOD file and pick "Convert .MOD to .MID" and you'll see that
mod's samples in ...\device\syn\_\[modfilename]\[samplename].WAV :)

You can get some decent 16 bit .WAVs from .SF2 files.
See my UnSF2 docs.


Try these...

Most of SYN's drums are from:

Keeping track of your samples is TOUGH !!

Make sure you preview the .WAV files you find with WAVPlayer and
=DO NOT= mix new unreviewed samples with your "known good" set.
Always put new samples into a "to review" directory (I use a _ dir).


Ok, go and build your sounds !!   :)))
