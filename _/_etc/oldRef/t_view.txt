<h1>Tinkerer - viewing songs</h1>
<pre>

Tinkerer's goal in life is NON realtime editing of songs.
   All the things you don't have time to do while PLAYING songs.
   Composition, editing and all that.
________________________________________________________________________________

Use Tinkerer to view a song's tracks' notes/drums/controls...

Clicking on the eye button in PianoCheetah will
   load the current song into Tinkerer
   and sync the current bar in Tinkerer's display to the bar playing.
   Click the eye button again to toggle syncing off.

If you're going to EDIT the song, EXIT PianoCheetah since PianoCheetah will
   save on TOP of your edits when it changes songs...:(

Tinkerer gives you a GOOD view of the song's tracks' events.

Notes are displayed in piano roll style.
   - Durations are shown horizontally in time.
        See the bar lines and beat lines?  This song has a time sig of 2/4

   - Notes are shown vertically in black and white (like piano keys).
        See the black keys and white keys?
        C notes are a little whiter, and middle C is the whitest.

   - Note velocities shown in color.
        There's a thin rainbow-y color scale at the top of the note area.
        showing the colors that map to velocities 1..127
           So green..blue means -barely- touched and
           red..yellow means BANGED on, etc.

   - You can also color notes by track or by sound.  (via the Col: droplist)

   You can click on the Track droplist to pick which tracks to look at.
   The default is "all of em at once" - kinda gory sometimes.

Drums are displayed just below notes.
   I give the drums short 4 character labels.  Kinda cryptic, but oh well.
   The ones above stand for TomFloorLow, CrashCymbal2, CrashCymbal, RideCymbal2,
      RideCymbal, SnareDrum2, SnareDrum.  (No KickDrum in this song)

Controls are displayed below the drums.
   Click in the Ctrl: droplist to pick the ones you want to see.
   Some are shown as text,
   Some with a teeny square around each individual event with lines between

Play around with the fields at the top of the window to scroll and zoom, etc.
