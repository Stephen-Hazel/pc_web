<h1>Piano Practice</h1>
Sheet Music


Well, you know those lines and dots and flags and bars and stuff?
Yeah, you're gonna have to learn to read that.
It's used by musicians who <b>you</b> need to speak music with.

Music notation programs all write out midi files.
PianoCheetah turns that into what <b>Steve</b> considers better notation.

Tons of websites (see my misc/links page) teach standard notation.  So not mine.
But what it does is show you the rhythms of notes of a song.
Not just to a piano player.  Any sort of musician.



<h1>MIDI files suuuck</h1>
That's what a lot of people say.  A midi file stores the notes of a song.

There's a big difference between a human "performance" of a song and
a computer playing straight sheet music.

Sheet music doesn't specify exactly how loud to play each note.  Or how exactly
to mess with the tempo.  It has general text instructions but the detail is
left to the artist - you.

A performance is how one particular human decided to play a song.
That's a lot more detailed than sheet music gets.
A midi file can store it <b>exactly</b>, though.

Once your brain really understands <b>every</b> nuance of the as written song,
it can play with tempo and make the listener wait or surprise the listener.
You can bring the overall volume up at a particular part or accent individual
lines of a song.

So think of it like  (sheet music) + (human offset) => (performance)

The reason most midi files suuuck is just that a human didn't play the music.
Every note has the exact same volume.
Every rhythm hits right on the clock tick.  Bland.  Boring.

Also, the synthesizer could be of low quality.
Like the one built into Windows.  Argh.



<h1>MIDI files are actually awesome</h1>
They are a <b>great</b> source of pop music.
Possibly the only source of notation for a <b>lot</b> of pop songs.

Sometimes, a human actually recorded the midi file.
So you can see the nuances of what they did to really <b>punch</b> that song.
