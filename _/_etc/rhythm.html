Most of a song's rhythms may not be too tricky.
But sometimes things get "jazzy".
They get intricate enough that you <b>have</b> to count them out.

A good way to do that is figure out the highest precision you need
to count in the section

  Here's an example courtesy of "DragonPianoPlayer" of PianoWorld.com forums:

  Just quarter notes?
     1 2 3 4

  Eighth notes too?
     1 &  2 &  3 &  4 &

  Sixteenth notes too?  Hoo boy.  Pop, eh?
     1 e & a  2 e & a  3 e & a  4 e & a

  Oh waltz time?  3/4?
     1 2 3

  Oh 6/8?
     MAYbe  1 &  2 &  3 &
     but, more than likely actually  1 2 3  1 2 3

  Oh some tricky blues?  they often go:
     1 & a  2 & a  3 & a  4 & a


You just gotta calculate it out.
   Make sure you get em right, or the song may be "jazzy",
      but not in a good way :)
