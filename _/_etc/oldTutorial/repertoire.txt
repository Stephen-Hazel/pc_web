<h1>Repertoire - keeping your songs in your fingers (and brain)</h1>


<h1>Finding songs</h1>
I've got a few packs of songs for you to download.
They're not the greatest, but they're a start.
Click <img src="img/slst.png"> for SongList dialog.
Click <img src="img/zap.png"> to list some songs to download into your Queue.
   <b>By the way, hovering over PianoCheetah toolbar buttons pops some help.</b>

Or put <b>midi</b>, a song's <b>title</b>, and <b>artist</b> into google.
Download every single one to try because the arrangement may suck for piano.
They're often for karaoke.  We'll talk about rearranging songs for piano later.

If you learn the song, <b>buy</b> it.  You owe the composer.  Don't be evil.



<h1>Keeping songs</h1>
Once you learn a song, you <b>still</b> need to practice it.
If you don't, it'll slip from your fingers (brain).
So put your "repertoire" songs on a weekly rotation <em>with</em>
your daily rotation of songs you're currently learning.

PianoCheetah keeps track of the songs you learn by
scribbling down the day <em>into</em> the midi file when you practice a song.
It rebuilds your list of songs for today based on their last practice date.

You now have <b>proof</b> of how many days it took you to learn a song.
   People always say "That's an easy one - done in 2 weeks".
   Yeah, riiiiiiight...  Prove it!



<h1>Where are they?</h1>
You picked a PianoCheetahSongs dir when you installed.

You can find it by clicking this guy:  <img src="img/slst.png">

That'll pop the SongList dialog which has a toolbar with (sorry) the same
dang icon.  Click that guy to browse to your PianoCheetahSongs dir.

Any midi song file outside PianoCheetahSongs will <b>not</b> be edited.
Once you've loaded a song into PianoCheetah, Click this guy:
<img src="img/cfg.png"> to open the song's config.
From here, set <b>practice stage</b> to Queue or Learning to
copy it in so PianoCheetah can edit it.

<b>Don't</b> keep your monster pile of midis in PianoCheetahSongs.
   It's only for songs you plan on <em>practicing</em> near term.

<b>Do</b> keep a backup of PianoCheetahSongs.  Please.



PianoCheetahSongs organizes your songs in subdirectories:

<h1>Queue</h1>
   It all starts with <em>that song is awesome - i neeeed to learn it!!</em>...
   Stick 'em here.  Don't let this pile get too huge.
   They sort to the end of the song list as there's no point in seeing
                                                 all that during daily practice.
<h1>Learning</h1>
   Songs you're actively working on every day.  Usually a couple of them.

<h1>Repertoire</h1>
   Songs you already know and want to keep <b>fresh</b>.  Practice these weekly.

<h1>Done</h1>
   You've got a good recording of it and don't need it in your brain anymore.
   But you've got nice fingering, loops, and cues saved so you can pick it up
      again some day with ease.

<h1>...DELETE IT</h1>
   That song sucked after all.  No mercy!
   But if it's just too hard for <b>now</b>, throw it back in Queue.



Now the rubber meets pavement - <a href="practice.html">piano practice</a> !
