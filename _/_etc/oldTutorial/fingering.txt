<h1>Fingering, Fractures, and Feel (oh my!)</h1>
Playing through a song from start to finish is <b>not</b> practicing it.
Playing through is your reward when your practice for the day is complete.

To improve, you'll need to practice carefully and <b>efficiently</b>.
 - Mark where hands hop and fingering gets tricky.
 - Stop wasting time practicing repeated sections.
 - Find and loop the tricky sections so we can nail them to the wall.
 - Make Cues to remind yourself how the feel should go.

Let's break it down.


<h1>Fingering</h1>
We need to mark fingering so we practice <b>one</b> movement.
   Each practice rep needs to be identical so our brains can memorize, store
   and optimize the movement.  (This all happens overnight.  Get good sleep.)

Click on the top half of a note to pick fingering for it.
                                <img style="float:right;" src="img/fing.png">
Don't put fingering on every dang note.
   Only when your finger needs to <b>move</b> to a note.
   (during hand position changes or <em>reuse</em> of a finger)
   Don't label 1 and 5 very much.  They're obvious - they're on the edges.
   Only finger <em>tricky</em> parts.
   (Some fingering tips are over <a rel="x"
                                    href="../practice/fingering.html">here</a>.)

<h1>Skip the repeats and loop it up</h1>
Songs repeat.  A <b>lot</b>.
That's great - we can practice all those sections <em>just</em> once.
Click in the Cues area of the note display.
Click the orange loop thing:

PianoCheetah looks through all your bars and finds the duplicates.
It marks sections to <em>skip</em> with ( and ) .
It also loops up the remaining bars into 4 bar loops with [ and ]
so you can concentrate and master each one individually.
Much better than fixing almost nothing as you mindlessly plow through every bar.


<h1>Fractures</h1>
Charles Cooke in "Playing the Piano for Pleasure" writes
   "Surgeons tell us that a broken arm or leg, if it is correctly set,
    becomes strongest at the point of fracture."
He goes on to explain <b>fractures</b> as the tricky parts of songs where things
can <em>break down</em>.
We should systematically label these areas and practice them very carefully.

Identifying tricky spots is your primary job during practice.
Once found, click in the Cues area and put a loop starting with [* around it.
   Which brings us to the type of loop [, [*, [LH/RH, and [LH/RH/HT.
   [ loops will be wiped and redone on each AutoLoop recalc.
   [* means the loop is permanent.
   [LH/RH means alternate LH and RH each time through the loop.
   And the last adds a hands together alternate.
Remember - although LH and RH may individually repeat a <em>lot</em>,
in HT there may be very few repeats - due to hand combinations.
Here's a full scale screen shot of looping.
Those light blue shaded areas are <b>all</b> repeats.  Already practiced!
Green now line is at the start of the loop which is a bolder red as it's the
current loop you're on.
There's a quarter bar lead in and let out so your loops overlap and you practice
the transition.

I don't know about you, but I think that's pretty dang cool.


<h1>Now we need to carefully practice it</h1>
First, without looping, go through the piece and wherever your hand hops or
fingering is tricky, label the note with the finger.

Next, turn looping on by clicking that arrow button.
   straight arrow means looping off, circle arrow means looping on.

cursor right/left (or command note) hops you to the next/previous loop.

One useful trick is to practice the <em>last</em>loop of the song and on
back to the start.
Practicing the <em>end</em> of the song most will <em>nail</em> the finish!


<h1>Practice the right stuff first</h1>
<b>Slow, smooth, and exact</b> comes first.
If you can't play it slow, it'll be slop when you play it fast.

Next, play it as <em>relaxed</em> as possible.
If your body isn't relaxed, you'll tire and start flubbing things.
Or worse, you'll start getting some serious pain.
Make sure you're <em>shaken out</em> and limber.
Your piano teacher will help you with this.

Next, add speed to get it to tempo.  Speed <b>last</b>.

Oh wait, <em>riiiiight</em> before speed comes...


<h1>Feel</h1>
Feel refers to careful adjusting of individual note volumes and use of legato.
Also to use of pedal, and small variations to the tempo to make a song
<b>feel</b> more expressive and natural and just plain <em>better</em>.

You can also click in the Cues area to the right of the notes to add
dynamics, text notes, or any text, really.
(I use <- for crescendo, >- for decrescendo, and -< and -> at their end)

Label it so you remember it (possibly <em>years</em>) later !!
