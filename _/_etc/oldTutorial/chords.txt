PianoCheetah will take a shot at guessing your song's chords.
Click in the Chords area to the right of the notes and you'll see:
<img src="img/chd.png">

Click the lightning bolt button
   PianoCheetah will look at your notes to practice
   (not the background tracks - make them a "to practice" track
    if you want them to be used in the chord guessing.)
   and put some chords into the chord track to the right of the notes.

   Then you can click on them and edit them until they're correct.

Once you have chords edited, you can mess with the song's background.

Go out on the internet and find a bunch of .sty files.
They're a weird format of midi for background tracks.
Put them all in this directory:
   ...\PianoCheetahSongs\SongClip\Style

Go back into the chord dialog and click the green refresh arrows button.
   That converts all the .sty files in that ...\SongClip\Style dir.
   It makes 4 directories (main, fill, intro, outro) in that same dir.
   In there is a .mid file per style "part".

Edit the first chord in the song and give it Section=main, StyleID=a
It'll show in the Chords track as C.a  (.a tacked onto whichever chord).
   G7!b would be "fill" style b.

The .a keeps going across chords without any .a or !a until the next style spec.

Then you pick style clips (midi clips) to <b>use</b> for <b>.a</b>.
So it's easy to swap to a different style.

When you do this, PianoCheetah will <b>trash</b> your drumtrack with whatever
those style have.  Be ready for that...


I'm hoping this'll help me in composing new songs given existing ones.

And eventually I'll work in some kind of "play background chords live" thingy.
Not quite sure how I wanna go about that part yet.
But triggered from the (midi) keyboard.



<h1>That's all I got for now.  Stay tuned for
<b>styles as a metronome</b>
<b>drum notes</b>
<b>other stuffs:/</b></h1>
