<h1>Practice - Let's prep that song for practice and PLAY IT!</h1>


<h1>What's a track?</h1>
Here's what the track control looks like:

If you don't see it, click this little guy: <img src="img/trk_on.png">

Midi files hold notes for lots of instruments, not just piano.
A track holds notes for <em>one</em> of the instruments.
   Maybe even for just a part.

We keep piano left and right hand notes in seperate tracks so
 - they show up differently.
 - as we practice one hand, PianoCheetah can play the other.


<h1>Finding the piano tracks and splitting left and right hands</h1>
Hopefully the midi files you find have nicely named piano tracks split into
left and right hand.
PianoCheetah tries to sort piano tracks to the top.  (It takes guesswork.)

Click the leftmost column of a track you suspect is piano.
It'll turn into a hand, show it in the note display, and make you play it.
<img src="img/hand.png">
Green arrow tracks are autoplayed and their notes aren't shown.
If you're not seeing any notes, click this guy: <img src="img/note.png">

Set learn mode to "Hear Mine"
<img src="img/lrn.png">
And see if it sounds like a keyboard part.
   If not, click it back to autoplay.
   If so, click the Hand column (next over) to set it to LH or RH.
   (whichever side it has the most notes on.)

Now you're ready to start moving notes to the other hand (or killing 'em).
If you don't have a track for the missing hand, add one by...
   click on the <b>Events</b> column of the piano track you <em>do</em> have.
   click the plus button to add a track like it.
   click the <b>Hand</b> column to set LH or RH.

Now move the notes to the correct hand.
Click <em>near</em> to one corner of the notes (not <em>on</em> a note),
   and drag a rectangle around the (starts of) notes to move.
   Then pick the hand to move them to.

OK!  Now we can practice !!


<h1>Phases of Piano Practice</h1>
Now that there are tracks to practice, we set <b>how</b> we'll practice.
Click this guy again and set it to <b>Learn</b>:
<img src="img/lrn.png">

<h1>HearAll</h1>
Plays <b>all</b> the tracks.  What your audience hears.

<h1>HearMine</h1>
Plays <b>only</b> your practice tracks.

<h1>Learn</h1>
<em>Waits</em> for you to get the notes right.
This'll help you
 - Find the notes you need.
 - Figure out when to change hand positions and fingering.
   (Can you reach the leftmost with your thumb and rightmost with pinky?)
 - Learn the rhythms in detail.
   (Especially against a drum track with 16th notes.  metronome = ANNOYING !!)
<em>Your</em> overall playing volume will <b>scale</b> the backgrounds'.
The background automatically <em>follows</em> your "feel".

<h1>Lead</h1>
Sorry - this doesn't work well yet...
You lead the song's time with your live playing.
As you play, PianoCheetah tracks (guesses) where you are and syncs the
tempo and background tracks.  According to <b>your</b> playing.
Keeping the background tracks in LOCK STEP with you.
Taking into account your rubato.
As I say, umm, much work to do.  It <em>kind of</em> works...:/

<h1>Follow</h1>
This only shows you the notes going by...  You record live as best you can.



<h1>Save!</h1>
PianoCheetah is always recording.  Press F1 to see help and do "save song".
If you happen to get a good recording during practice, <b>save it</b>.
You'll find it in the <b>Recorded</b> dir within PianoCheetahSongs.



<h1>Ok, play that song through <b>only</b> once or twice.  Then we do...</h1>
