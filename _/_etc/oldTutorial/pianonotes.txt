<h1>PianoNotes - a nice way for piano players to read music</h1>
Let's jump right in with an example.
Here's a nice simple song in standard notation:

<img src='img/row_sn.png'>



<h1> And again in PianoNotes notation</h1>

<img src='img/row_pn.png'>


We have a grid of <b>time</b> (up/down) and <b>notes</b> (left/right).


<h1>Time</h1>
Time starts at the top and goes to the bottom, continuing in the next column.

It's broken into bars (thick dark blue lines),  then beats (light grey),
and optionally subbeats (not shown here - to show 16ths, etc).
This is your current "time signature".  3 beats per bar in this song.

See how some bars are squished shorter when they're not very busy?
Bars are numbered so you can sync up with somebody else.


<h1>Notes</h1>
Notes are oriented exactly as they are on piano.

This song uses only white keys, but black ones will show up narrower and with
a leading black dot instead of the white one.

There's a "key signature" of colored squares on top the header keyboard showing
the current scale.  Dark red is the tonic.  So this is C Major:
   Since it's major, the 3rd is regular green.
   If it was minor, the 3rd would be yellow-green one key left.  6th and 7th too

The darker thin vertical red line shows middle C.
Lighter ones show other B|C (octave) borders.
                                   <img style="float:right;" src="img/fing.png">
Some notes have a fingering number leading them =>

Notes <b>lean</b> left or right depending on the hand used to play them.

Notes can be colored by note of the scale (shown here), by track, and velocity.


<h1>Active Notation</h1>
PianoNotes move.  They <em>know</em> what you're playing.

<img src="img/act.png">
That green line will scoot on down the page - always at your place in time.
When it reach notes, <b>play</b> 'em, man !!
When it leaves them, just let 'em go...

If you miss a note, a <b>green light</b> shows  <em>hey play me</em>.
If you hit a wrong note, a <b>red light</b> means  <em>wrong one</em>, dude.
PianoNotes pause until you get it right.
Once you do, all is clear and time marches on.

Those bumpy black notes are your signposts.  You <b>never</b> have to look down.
Even when the hops are far, practice them watching only the <em>dots</em> and
<em>feeling</em> the result.
Feel the 2 versus 3 black keys for where your hands are.
They're slighly different hues on screen, too.

As you play, pink trails show <em>your</em> notes on top of the ones to learn.
                                                                     (see video)

<h1>Lyrics, etc</h1><img style="float:right;" src="img/lyr.png">
Lyrics show in the top, right corner of PianoCheetah's window.
2 lines with the current syllable hilighted.

Chords and Cues are shown in columns to the right of the notes.
Cues are textual notations for parts of the song.
Things like pp, F, crescendo, decrescendo, etc.
Chords, loops, and drum notes will be discussed later.


<h1>Ok,</h1>
I realize this looks kind of cryptic at first.

But in the (<em>not so</em>) long run, you'll be able to
read the rhythms and notes <b>much</b> more quickly than from standard notation.

In standard notation, many things need to be <b>interpretted</b> by your brain.
   staff + 8va + line/space + key signature + sharp/flat => key
   dot + flags + beams + ties + time signature => time/duration

That's what slows you down and frustrates you about standard notation.
As you use it a <em>lot</em> more, they slow and frustrate you less.
But they'll always slow and frustrate you <b>some</b>.

With PianoNotes, these things are seen plainly and directly.
(Not saying things won't be a <em>little</em> frustrating at the start.)



Ok, let's go <em>get</em> some songs to <a href='repertoire.html'>play</a>.
