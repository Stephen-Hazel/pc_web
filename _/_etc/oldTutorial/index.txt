<h1>Goooooooal !! - our goal with PianoCheetah</h1>

Our goal is to become a good keyboard musician - a piano and synthesizer player.

But not in the traditional way (with an acoustic piano and paper sheet music).
We'll be using a digital piano and PianoCheetah.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with the traditional way.
My main goal is to do things the traditional way as much as possible.
But with a <b>dang</b> computer.  And in simpler ways when possible.



<h1>Your Piano</h1>

It'd be great if we could all have an acoustic piano.
If you've got money, space, and understanding family/neighbors, <b>great</b>!
And if you can afford an acoustic, you sure as heck can afford a digital to
go with.  (Why burn out your tuning and family's nerves on early practices?)

Start with a <a rel="x" href="../piano/index.html">digital piano rig</a>.



<h1>Standard Notation</h1>

Sheet music is <b>hard</b> to read.

Now, there's no getting around it - you need to be able to read it.
But let's start with <b>PianoNotes</b> notation.

You can learn standard notation from your piano teacher or on your own.
I've spent a <em>lot</em> of time trying to cram all the good stuff standard
notation does <em>into</em> PianoNotes notation.

I don't expect PianoNotes to ever become the standard.
But it is just plain <b>faster</b> to learn a song with it.  Period.

PianoCheetah will eventually show standard notation, too.
It <em>used</em> to.  But I need it out so I can get new functions in faster.
It'll be back when things simmer down.



<h1>Piano Practice = FUN !!</h1>

PianoCheetah has a lot of cool things it can do to help you out.  It can...
 - spoon feed you the notes and pause as you try to grok 'em.
 - split up notes per hand and stamp fingerings so you practice <b>one</b> way.
 - skip over repeated bars so you're not wasting your time with them.
 - loop up the tough parts so you can nail them to wall.

There's more stuff it'll do.  But this is an intro.  Onward!



Let's dive into <a href='pianonotes.html'>PianoNotes</a> notation so
you can start playing songs.  It'll be quick and fun, I promise.
