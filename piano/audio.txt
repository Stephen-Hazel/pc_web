2 of these 1/4" mono female jacks for audio out


Here's your PC's audio:

there's a 1/8" stereo female jack each for [audio in], [audio out],
 and [mic in].  I don't use microphone in.

2 of these rca female jacks for audio in


<hr>
They look pretty frustratingly different !!
 But in general stereo audio needs to go from
 Keyboard => PC => stereo (or powered speakers)



You usually use rca cables between em:

And usually two adapters for your keyboard's 1/4" mono plugs.
(Two of these to get a stereo rca female jack pair)

And usually an adapter to go from dual rca female to 1/8" stereo male

<h3>Mixer</h3>
When you get more than one instrument involved (microphone, drums, guitar, etc),
 now you need a mixer.

Everything goes into the mixer.  (Including PC audio out from your softsynth)

And the output goes to your stereo, headphones, and PC Audio in (to record).
