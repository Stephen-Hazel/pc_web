Just a single USB cable from piano to PC.
Install driver software from keyboard manufacturer.

USB midi can <b>very</b> rarely cause audio interference.
If so, swap to standard midi cables.  They never do.

Otherwise, you're stuck with "old school" midi cables.

You'll need a midi interface for your PC.
 connecting your PC's usb port to midi in and out plugs.
 Install driver software from the <b>midi interface manufacturer</b>
 (not from the keyboard manufacturer).

Don't get a <b>really</b> cheap one or the driver may have bugs.
